# 2-host logical pipeline-parallel job: simulates two PP stages as two
# independent processes on the same runner. The test exercises the full
# production code path under `src/distributed/pipeline/` — coordinator,
# activation transport, remote stage service, and scheduler — using the
# loopback TCP transport. This is the minimum viable guardrail for every
# PR that touches PP-related code.
#
# The underlying production code is exercised by the integration test
# `pipeline_multi_stage_two_host_logical_smoke` in
# `tests/pipeline_ci_multi_stage_real_models.rs`. The test is gated with
# `#[ignore]` because it needs a local model checkout, so it is driven
# from this script with `--ignored`.
#
# When model weights are present the test runs a real forward pass across
# two stages; when they are absent the test skips cleanly (exit 0), which
# keeps the GitHub-hosted runner job green while still catching regressions
# in everything that can be linked and compiled without model weights.
#
# Optional environment:
#   TEST_MODEL       Model directory name. Default: `llama-3.2-1b-4bit`.
#   CARGO_PROFILE    `debug` (default) or `release`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/ci/run-pp-two-host-logical.sh
